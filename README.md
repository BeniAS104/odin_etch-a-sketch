# [Etch A Sketch](http://etchasketch.bendev.dk/)
A dynamic and interactive Etch A Sketch drawing application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Made in mind with The Odin Project Course. <br> This project was undertaken to deepen my understanding of front-end development, with a focus on user interaction and responsive design.

<h2>Project Brief</h2>
Type: Web Development, Interactive Design <br>
Date: September 2024 <br>
Technology Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customizable Board Size:</strong> Users can change the size of the drawing grid to suit their preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Drawing Functionality:</strong> Click and drag to draw on the grid. Includes options for color selection, random colors, and an eraser feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Board Creation:</strong> Automatically generates a grid based on user input and allows immediate drawing.</li>
    <li><strong>Reset Functionality:</strong> Clear the entire drawing board with a reset button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learnings</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Gained practical experience in handling mouse events to manage drawing state and interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic DOM Manipulation:</strong> Developed skills in creating and updating HTML elements dynamically based on user input.</li>
